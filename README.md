Game of blackjack where the ace is 11 and its going to count as 11 until the user goes over 21. We also assume we have
an infinite depth so it means that when a card is drawn from the deck it is not removed from the deck where as in a
casino they have maybe 6 or 8 decks of cards and when a card is drawn there is less probability of that card being drawn again.
However we want to keep things simple so we assume an infinite deck. REMMEBER THE DEALER KEEPS DRAWING CARDS UNTIL 17 OR
ABOVE IS REACHED.
